1. Clone the repository
2. Run `python3 main.py <filepath of image>`

### Optional arguments
1. `python3 main.py --num_points <filepath of image>` will display the number of points used to compute the sum of 
intensity for every theta.
2. `python3 main.py --show_all_points <filepath of image>` will display the intensity of all the points which added to 
calculate the sum of intensity
